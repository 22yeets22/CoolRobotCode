# 2025-2026 Push Back

## Overview
Push Back is the 2025-2026 VEX Robotics Competition game.

## Changes
- **Switched to PROS**: This year we switched from the default VEX SDK to PROS for our programming environment. This allowed us to have more control over our code and utilize advanced features that were not available in the default SDK.
- **LemLib**: With the switch to PROS, we also adopted LemLib, a library that allowed us to streamline the creation of odometry. This significantly reduced the amount of code we had to write for auton.
- **Auton Switcher**: We implemented an auton switcher that allows us to easily select different autonomous routines before a match. This made it easier since we didn't need 4 programs for 4 different autons.
